	                      Configure NFS server to share directories on your network...

  1) NFS, or Network File System, is a distributed file system protocol that allows you to mount remote directories on your server.
  2) This lets you manage storage space in a different location and write to that space from multiple clients.			
  3) NFS provides a relatively quick and easy way to access remote systems over a network and works well in situations where the shared resources will be accessed regularly.
