Configure SSH server to manage a server from the remote computer....

 1) Secure Shell, sometimes referred to as Secure Socket Shell, is a protocol which allows you to connect securely to a remote computer or a server by using a text-based interface.
 2) When a secure SSH connection is established, a shell session will be started, and you will be able to manipulate the server by typing commands within the client on your local computer.

 Commands : 
	>> ssh
	>> sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	>> sudo systemctl status ssh
	>> sudo systemctl start ssh
	>> ssh localhost
        >> sudo apt-get install ufw
        >> sudo systemctl start ufw
        >> sudo systemctl status ufw
        >> sudo ufw allow ssh
        >> ssh 127.0.0.1
